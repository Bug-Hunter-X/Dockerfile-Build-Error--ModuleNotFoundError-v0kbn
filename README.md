This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles:  failing to install necessary dependencies within the image before attempting to run application code.  The `bug.Dockerfile` illustrates the problem, which manifests as a `ModuleNotFoundError` during test execution because the required Python packages are not present in the base image.  The `solution.Dockerfile` provides a corrected version that explicitly installs the needed packages, resolving the error.
